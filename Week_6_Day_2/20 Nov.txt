Recap
	1. diff between API and webservices ?
			- all Webservices are API
			- but not all API are webservices
		
	2. can you name some of the http methods other then GET,POST,PUT,PATCH and DELETE
		Option - will give us the list of allowed methods for that endpoint/resource
		Head   - which can give you the status code 
		
	GraphQL
		- limitaitons of REST 
			- too many endpoints 
			- Overfetching
			- underfetching
			
		facebook
			- 2012
			- 2015 - open source
			
			four things
				- Query 			- query format
				- Mutations			- modification
				- Resolvers			- query format match with the conditions - Java script as a function
				- Subscriptions		- similar to the triggers - server automatically responds to the client
				
				https methods	
					- GET
					- POST
					
					
					servicenow resource - /api/now/graphql
					
		gRPC
			- so far we are using http 1.1
			- http 2 - binary format
			
			rest, graphql - 4 secs
			gRPC - <1 sec
			
			Google   - created gRPC
			protobuf -  create a .proto file
			tools  - bloom gRPC, postman
			
			gRPC - netflix, amazon and many OTT platforms or heavy data 
			
			unary 				- client makes a request and then server responds 
			server streaming	- client makes a single req, server responds with stream of responses
			client streaming	- client makes a stream of requests, server responds with single response
			bidirectional		- both client and server can send stream of data simultaneously
			
			OAUTH
				1 vs 2.0 - 1 - supports desktop apps, 2 - supports web
			servicenow Oauth -

			auth end[oint - https://dev134534.service-now.com/oauth_auth.do
			
			Datatables in cucumber
			    examples and datatables
					examples   -  when you want to feed multiple values to feature
					datatables -  need differernt data in step level
					
					
					git flow - merge conflict
						- clone - one time
						
						
						- pull 
						- create/alter changes
						- add/commit changes
						- push changes to your remote
						- pull request 
						- merge this code to the master
						
						bitbucket
						github
						gitlab
						
						backlog
						standup
						sprint grooming - estimation
						sprint retro
						14 days
						
						wednesday - next friday
						
						Day to Day 
						- beiginign of the sprint - estimation of the tickets/stories(15) 
						- team lead or a senior person will assign the tickets
							- Jira or any project management tool
							- regression planned date
							
							
					jira
					servicenow
					salesforce
					
					CRUD
					
					banking
						- adding a payee and then transfering the money at once
						
						add payee - xxxxx.bank.com/api/now/payee
						transfer  - xxxxx.bank.com/cmd/bank/transfer
						getmoney  - xxxxx.bank.com/api/now/transcation
						
						
						- java
						- framework- testng, cucumber makaia
						- scenarios automation
						- usage of Jira,servicenow,salesforce
