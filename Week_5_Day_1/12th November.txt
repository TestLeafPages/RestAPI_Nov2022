03:00 PM - 03:20 PM 	: Recap
03:20 AM - 04:45 PM		: Makaia Framework (Overview + Code Explanation + Execution)
04:45 AM - 05:00 PM		: Break
05:00 PM - 06:00 PM		: Practice session on Makaia with ServiceNow
06:00 PM - 06:15 PM		: Recap and Assignments


Recap
	- merits of API testing
		- faster than UI
		- early testing
		- core functionality testing will be easier
		- not to rely on UI
		- less failures
		
	- HTTP Methods
		- GET
		- POST
		- PUT
		- PATCH
		- DELETE
		
	- different auth types
		- basic  - 10 to 20 %
		- oauth  - 70 to 80 %
		- bearer token
		- api key
		- no auth
		
	- limitations of postman
		- report generation
		- semi automation
		- integration to CICD
		- data is limited to csv and json
		- parallel execution
		- single unified framework
		- limted only to Javascript
		- depenedency injection
		
	- when to choose postman and when to choose REst Assured
		- postman- for simple projects when the requirements are minimal
		- rest assured - for large scale projects which also has UI
		
		Framework
				- simplifies your task, code reusablity, set of guidelines
			- testng
				- TDD, dependency, groups, running
			- cucumber
				- BDD 
					1.testng
					2.junit
					3.CLI
			- matchie - light weighted framework
			- makaia -
			objective - single unififed framework
			components - selenium + Rest Assured + TestNg+ Cucumber+Extent Report
			maven project - build management tool
			TEst data - excel, csv, json and database, file, .properties files
			
			static analysis
			
				POM.xml
					dependencies
						- webdrivermanager       - removes the browser depedenency

							@BeforeTest		- setting up values
							@BeforeClass	- starting the test case/script
							@BeforeMethod	- assigning the values
							@Test			- business logic
							@AfterMethod    - close the browser
							@AfterClass     - NA
							@AfterTest      - NA
							@AfterSuite     - end result
